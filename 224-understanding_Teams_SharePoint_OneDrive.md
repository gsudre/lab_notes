I did some reading today about Teams, OneDrive, and SharePoint, and I think
it'll help the lab quite a bit, especially as NIH already offers all those
tools.

A few useful links:

And extremely important, it's possible to store PII in those files, provided
it's not shared with non-NIH partners:

And this is NIH's version of the OneDrive VS SharePoint information:

* https://myitsm.nih.gov/sp?sys_kb_id=59e983acdb52ff40fc11f9531f9619b9&id=kb_article_view&sysparm_rank=2&sysparm_tsqueryId=b7cf45271bf364500e5bea82f54bcb13

And here's more info on Teams, from NIH (note that they say it's OK to share
sensitive information):

* https://myitsm.nih.gov/sp?sys_kb_id=cd7340a9dbf33384fc11f9531f961948&id=kb_article_view&sysparm_rank=13&sysparm_tsqueryId=8aefc1671bf364500e5bea82f54bcb43

Some nice recommendations on using Teams:

And here are the size limitations (for OneDrive is 1Tb per user, 25Tb for the
Team in SharePoint, 100Gb per file):
