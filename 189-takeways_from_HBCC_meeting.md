* Mine our data (e.g. DTE/DTU) to generate new hypothesis that can be answered
  by neuronal populations, using single nucleaus analysis. That can determine
  which neuronal populations to look at too.
    * Can do a 24x24 experiment for single nucleus sequencing in the ACC. 
* Look into talk by Vivradjev (?) about possibilities of single cell nucleus
* Ajay mentioned some theory to justify sperm motility sets
* Stephano has some ideas about axonal guidance and the sets we got for Caudate
* Stefano was wondering whether our depth was enough for DT analysis
* Ajay wondered why the Caudate volcano is so flat and weird
* Do we have data for specific reasons and different disorders? Instead of just
  using the meta analysis?
  What's driving all that shared correlation?
* What are those suicides for NVs?
* Is there an effect in the different batch histories (Stefano)?
* Why is CHR1 and other similar genes in serotonin set?
* We should push the methylome + transcriptome analysis/alignment of results
* Use categories of gene interactions/pathways too (networks). Stuff like IPA,
  to connect genes to function
* Can we look at the directionality of the GSEA results to generate hypothesis?
  For example, what does it mean to have VEGF high? Something about arteries
  walls and blood in ASD?
* Can we re-run this without the suicide cases? what differences does it make?

## From Philip:
 * Further bioinformatic analyses on the DGE (protein interactome; IPA; KEGG, https://string-db.org/)
 * Consider further how to integrate methylomics with the transcriptome findings (if possible- our initial attempts weren’t promising).
 * Try to obtain gene expression in the ACC/caudate from other psychiatric disorders to correlate with the ADHD findings.
 * Run mediation analyses to see if the association between polygenic risk for ADHD and the disorder in our cohort is explained (mediated) by gene expression.
 * Check out what's going on with Caudate volcano plot
 * we’ll formulate some hypotheses to drive a single nuclei sequencing project.
   ( from Ajeet) definitely the interaction data obtained from STING goes very
   well with Cytoscape (https://cytoscape.org/) for the represention of the
   networks by integrating the expression levels and associated metadata data.
 
Finish those analysis first before talking to other groups
