## Presentation
* Don't switch back and forth on the phenotype. Use just one term: structural
  connections, and we examine it in a finer level through voxels. We looked at
  two microstructural properties of those structural connections. 
* Mention the heritability values of each cluster.
* Start by mentioning I was a postdoc with Philip for 5 years, and last year In
  started as a bioinformatician in the lab.
* Do NOT focus on AD and RD, just mention it briefly.
* Mention that uncinate connects the limbic system and orbitofrontal cortex.
  Forceps minor being part of the corpus calossum, connecting the frontal lobes
  of both hemispheres.
* Don't focus on how just one region correlates. That's just an example of the
  association. 
* Focus on CHANGE. It's the rate of change of a microstructural property that
  was associated with the rate of change in symptoms, for both inattention and HI.

## Questions
* Why voxels and not tracts? We decided to use voxels here because it gives us a
  finer resolution, compared to looking at tracts defined in a template. There
  were methodological challenges in the past in using voxels, especially when
  related to multiple comparison corrections. Now we have those figured out.
* How do the baseline results compared to these change results? Use our family
  papers as foundation for it...
* What do you make of those opposing direction i the uncinate result? It
  highlights the dissociability of two different pathophysiological processes.
  We know from previous studies that the driving course of changes in
  inattention and HI only overlap at about 50% of genes. Here we are focusing on
  the association of heritable regions, so it's plausible that they would behave
  differently.
* What kind of other support do we need? I know that Dr. Shaw's tenure package
  is likely to include a dedicated clinician and more specialized genomic
  support. This will allow me to focus more on the neuroimaging, and more
  targeted genomic projects.
* What kind of training would I benefit from? I've done some very good training
  working with Dr. Ben Busby from NHLBI, exploring CNVs in ADHD simplex
  families. I learned a lot in that 2-month internship, and now we're continuing
  the project in a collaboration with Broad. Any opportunities like that, where
  I can further expand my neuroimaging or genomics methods background, are
  always useful. I've also organized the MEG and Depp Learning interest groups
  here at NIH.
* 

## TODO
* Re-read our previous papers, especially the ones cited as key papers and the
  heritability one.
* Make correlation between change in inattention and HI. Send scatterplot and
  values to Philip.
* Check trend direction for forceps minor cluster.
* Find out the heritability and SE of peak voxel in the clusters.
* Remind myself on how SOLAR computes heritability, and how it is different from
  familiarity.
