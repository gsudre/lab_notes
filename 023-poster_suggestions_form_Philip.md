## Presentation
* Stick with what's in the introduction: 1) change is heritable; 2) Longitudinal
  studies didn't look at DTI; 3) It's important for ADHD because...
* Don't switch back and forth on the phenotype. Use just one term: structural
  connections, and we examine it in a finer level through voxels. We looked at
  two microstructural properties of those structural connections. 
* Mention the heritability values of each cluster.
* Start by mentioning I was a postdoc with Philip for 5 years, and last year In
  started as a bioinformatician in the lab.
* Do NOT focus on AD and RD, just mention it briefly.
* Mention that uncinate connects the limbic system and orbitofrontal cortex.
  Forceps minor being part of the corpus calossum, connecting the frontal lobes
  of both hemispheres.
* Don't focus on how just one region correlates. That's just an example of the
  association. 
* Focus on CHANGE. It's the rate of change of a microstructural property that
  was associated with the rate of change in symptoms, for both inattention and HI.

## Questions
* Why voxels and not tracts? We decided to use voxels here because it gives us a
  finer resolution, compared to looking at tracts defined in a template. There
  were methodological challenges in the past in using voxels, especially when
  related to multiple comparison corrections. Now we have those figured out.
* How do the baseline results compared to these change results? Use our family
  papers as foundation for it...
* What do you make of those opposing direction i the uncinate result?
  1. In our data the rate of change of inattention and hI are not associated-
     likely reflecting independent, underlying processes
  2. Additionally, twin studies show that change in inattention and change in HI
     are only partly genetically correlated-  that is, they have a largely
     independent genomic underpinnings.  And in this study we are examining
     correlations with heritable, genetically driven. change in white matter.
* What kind of other support do we need? I know that Dr. Shaw's tenure package
  is likely to include a dedicated clinician and more specialized genomic
  support. This will allow me to focus more on the neuroimaging, and more
  targeted genomic projects.
* What kind of training would I benefit from? I've done some very good training
  working with Dr. Ben Busby from NHLBI, exploring CNVs in ADHD simplex
  families. I learned a lot in that 2-month internship, and now we're continuing
  the project in a collaboration with Broad. Any opportunities like that, where
  I can further expand my neuroimaging or genomics methods background, are
  always useful. I've also organized the MEG and Depp Learning interest groups
  here at NIH.


## TODO
* Re-read our previous papers, especially the ones cited as key papers and the
  heritability one.
* Make correlation between change in inattention and HI. Send scatterplot and
  values to Philip.
  - not significant for ADHD_NOS (p=.48) or ADHD (p=.50). Not fair comparison
    including NVs because of all the 0s. We report the ADHD_NOS results.
* Check trend direction for forceps minor cluster.
  - Same direction for inattention (positive T), not close to significance for HI.
* Find out the heritability and SE of peak voxel in the clusters.
  - AD: h^2r = .61 ($\pm$ .27)
  - RD: h^2r = .63 ($\pm$ .21)
* Remind myself on how SOLAR computes heritability, and how it is different from
  familiarity.
