Let's investigate the possibility of doing FUSION in our bigger datasets. The
first paper that comes to mind is this:

which does something similar, but they stuck to the summary GWAS data. If we did
this in an individual level, and then used the brain, across different cohorts,
would it be interesting enough?

Chatting with Philip he said I should go forward with this project. Potentially
using the mediation scheme of brain mediating behavior/SX, with predicted
expression as X. OR try using MESC again. But definitely try to impute many
different regions, hopefully in the same developmental stage as our own data.
