I had a catch up meeting with Philip yesterday to lay out the plan to finalize
this analysis. The overall feeling is that it will be a negative, but let's
explore all venues  first before publishing on that. Here are the next things to
tackle:

* Focus on PRS. Really try everything I can. 
  * Try one per family (probably the one with best neuroimaging), and/or use
    family as random term. 
  * Try WNH only, including PCs
* Focus on descriptives first!
* Do within domain first, then adding the cumulative approach starting with
  clinical variables. There, do baseline SX, age, sex, IQ, and two dummy
  variables for comorbidities: internal (anxiety) and external (ODD, DMDD,
  conduct disorder).
* For rsFMRI, just do the same connectivity that prediction paper did, even
  though it's not the same preprocessing pipeline. We can caddress that in the
  discussion if it's an issue.
* Also play with total symptoms.
* Try the continuous rate of change again.
* Define different group threshold for inatt and HI. Maybe median? Or define a
  threshold that works best?  
* The approach will be to really stack it to one domain (potentially PRS, but
  maybe the brain), byt picking the best predictors and target there. And be
  upfront about it, saying that this is the best we can do even when we stack
  it. We shouldn't expect much more than that.
* Maybe we should try the old PRS vectors as well, just to compare the results?
  With that, Philip had some very nominal results.  
* Try mode and FA for DTI as well.
* Try starting at 3 and 4 symptoms for data inclusion.

## Questions:
 * Should I also use the persistence effect sizes for PRS?
