After chatting with Philip, we decided to go with a male-only analysis because
of the numbers we were left with after reducing to WNH (0 females in cases). So,
we'll lead with within-region analysis for males only, then:

* add women WNH with sex as a covariate (removing sex genes?)
* add everyone using nested population cluster nested inside batch

I imagine that for the last analysis I'll need dream, so I'll just go ahead and
use that for everything.
