Let's create a script that summarizes what each person did in their last visit.
For that, download all applicable custom data forms from Labmatrix. We won't
process anything that has the _old prefix, so that we leave room to clean up the
Custom data forms if needed.

# TODO
 * What is adult self?
 * Who has been genotyped 
 * Who has been sequenced
 * is subject in all_visits? is all_visits subj in res?
 * Where is the biospecimen acquired >= 2018

Who is in the study, when they signed a consent, and what they did in that day, FSIQ, date when obtained (make sure they match date of visit(, match to participant study membership file
How it was created, and how it was checked 
Biomaterials (make sure date matches whatâ€™s in the spreadsheet)

Philip,

Sorry for the delay. There was a lot to do, and I'm afraid still some to be
done. I was able to match a file BTRIS support had sent me last year, with the
dates for all consents (as seen in the Protocols tab in CRIS), to those dates in
the wide form spreadsheet. There were many missing that I had to add by hand
(over 120), and I had to correct some of the dates that were there as well (40
or so). I sent you an updated wide list in a new spreadsheet (conset_dates tab).
There are still a few dates in the wide list that we need to chat about: they
are the six with red comments in columns N:R in tab dates_comparison.

Now that I have a more reliable set of dates I can move on to add the info you
asked about biospecimens associated with consents from 2018 and on. I'll have
time to work on this over the weekend/holiday, so I'll send you a new
spreadsheet soon.
