Let's create a script that summarizes what each person did in their last visit.
For that, download all applicable custom data forms from Labmatrix. We won't
process anything that has the _old prefix, so that we leave room to clean up the
Custom data forms if needed.

```r

# TODO
 * What is adult self?
 * Who has been genotyped 
 * Who has been sequenced
 * is subject in all_visits? is all_visits subj in res?
 * Where is the biospecimen acquired >= 2018
 * Who has been genotyped 
 * Who has been sequenced


Who is in the study, when they signed a consent, and what they did in that day, FSIQ, date when obtained (make sure they match date of visit(, match to participant study membership file
How it was created, and how it was checked 
Biomaterials (make sure date matches whatâ€™s in the spreadsheet)
